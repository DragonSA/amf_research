Valuation of Convertible Bonds with Credit Risk
===============================================

Abstract
--------
A convertible bond is a complex derivative that cannot be priced as a simple
combination of bond and stock components.  Convertible bonds can be broken down
as a bond with two embedded options (a put option for the investor and a call
option for the issuer) and an option to convert the bond into stock.  Due to the
multiple continuous options, the pricing of the convertible bond is path
dependent.

This research project explores and implements a binary tree and finite
difference scheme to price the convertible bond, taking into account credit
risk.
