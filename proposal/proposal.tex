\def\abstractname{\Large Abstract}
\begin{abstract}
A convertible bond is a complex derivative that cannot be prices as a simple combination of bond and stock components.  Convertible bonds can be broken down as a bond with two embedded options (a put option for the investor and a call option for the issuer) and an option to convert the bond into stock.  Due to the multiple continuous options the pricing of the convertible bond is path dependent.

This research project explores and implements a finite difference scheme to price the convertible bond, taking into account credit risk.

\section{Introduction}
This research project aims to price convertible bonds based on the paper by \citet{AFV03}.

Convertible bonds are a hybrid instrument available on financial markets.  The convertible bond is an instrument that is similar to a normal bond except the holder has the option to convert the bond into a specified number of shares.  The convertible bond typically also has embedded options whereby the issuer may buy-back the convertible bond for a specified price and whereby the investor can force the issue to repurchase the convertible bond.  In the event of a default by the issuer the bond could have partial recovery or total default.

More rigorously, as described by \cite{AKW08}, the convertible bond can be specified as having:
\begin{itemize}
 \item A nominal value of $N$.  Without loss of generality it is assumes the convertible bond always matures at par.
 \item A maturity at time $T$.
 \item A continuous conversion provision held by the investor to convert the bond into \convK shares (for a value of \convKS).  Conversion may only happen in time set \convT (typically $T \in \convT$).
 \item A continuous call provision held by the issuer to buy-back the bond for \callK.  The investor may opt to convert the bond instead of received the buy-back value.  The call may only happen in the time set \callT.
 \item A continuous put provision held by the investor to force early conversion of the bond for \putK.  The put may only happen in the time set \putT.
\end{itemize}

As assumed by \cite{AFV03}, the probably of default in time set $[t, dt]$ is $p\,dt$ where $p(S, t)$ is a deterministic hazard rate.  The following assumptions will be made about the behaviour of the bond in the event of default:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The bond has recovery ratio of \defN, for a recovery value of $\defN N$.
 \item The share price reduced in value by \defS so that the share price after default $S^+ = S^- (1 - \defS)$ where $S^-$ is the share price immediately before default.
 \item The investor has an option of either receiving:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item $\defN N$, or
  \item $\convK S (1 - \defS)$
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The stock price is assumed to follow a standard Wiener process of:
\begin{displaymath}
dS = \mu S dt + \sigma S dz
\end{displaymath}
with drift rate $\mu$, volatility of $\sigma$ and Wiener process increment of $dz$ \cite{AFV03}.

\section{Literature Review}
Provide a literature review here.

\section{Research Method and Aims}
This research project aims to price convertible bonds with credit risk using a finite difference scheme to solve the difference equation numerically.

\Citet{AFV03} used a Crank-Nicolson scheme with modifications as described in \citet{R84}.  The BDF finite difference scheme \cite{B98} was proposed as an alternative finite difference scheme.  The Crank-Nicolson scheme will be implemented in Octave (a near Matlab compatible computer language).

A best effort will include compatibility with Matlab, pricing subject to credit risk and implementing a Monte Carlo simulation to compare pricing models.  \citet{AKW08} describes one such Monte Carlo based model.
